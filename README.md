# Task Management App

## Overview
The **Task Management App** is a simple task management tool that allows users to add, edit, delete, and track tasks. The app supports filtering tasks based on priority, completion status, and search functionality. It also allows sorting tasks by priority. The app stores tasks in `localStorage` for persistence across page refreshes.

## Features

1. **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks with a title and priority level (Low, Medium, or High).
2. **Task List**: All tasks are displayed with options to mark them as completed, edit, or delete.
3. **Edit Tasks**: Users can edit the title and priority of existing tasks.
4. **Delete Tasks**: Tasks can be deleted, with a confirmation prompt if the task is not completed.
5. **Filter Tasks**:
   - Filter by completion status (All, Completed, Incomplete).
   - Filter by priority (Low, Medium, High).
   - Search tasks by title.
6. **Sort Tasks**: Users can sort tasks by priority (Low to High or High to Low).
7. **Local Storage**: Tasks are saved in `localStorage`, so data persists even after page refreshes.
